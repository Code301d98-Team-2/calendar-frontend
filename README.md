## Overview

This application will generate shifts in a random order and ensure people work all shifts available. It will also ensure that shift constrains are being adhered to for example minimum staff and seniority requirements for patient care. 

## Why We Built This Application

Many healthcare institutions still rely on paper-based scheduling systems, which can result in a variety of issues. Management may exhibit favoritism by giving preferred employees more favorable shifts, leading to inequities in scheduling. Additionally, due to the lack of visibility, employees may be unaware of changes to the schedule, leading to confusion and potential scheduling conflicts. It is imperative that hospitals and other healthcare organizations transition to modern, digital scheduling systems to improve efficiency and ensure fair and transparent scheduling practices.

## Getting Started

1. Create a new React application on your local machine.
2. Create a GitHub repository and clone this project onto your local machine into the new React application folder.
3. Create a new user account on SendGrid and get your own personal API key.
4. 
4. Create a .env file and change the API key using the sample in the .env.sample file
5. Start the application using your favorite code editor!

## Architecture

Built using React, Bootstrap, and axios API handler.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
