                                <p>Hi, I'm Jeanette. I recently got out the military to pursue a different career path.
                                I am student at Code Fellows and soon to be enrolled in UC San Diego to pursue a computer science degree.
                                I wanted to get into software development for game design and development. I fell in love with video games when I was five.
                                The first few videos games that shaped my childhood were Marvel vs Capcom, Super Mario 64, Banjo Kazooie, Star Wars Ep 1: Racer, Medal of Honor and
                                Donkey Kong.</p>
                                I think I fell in love with video games because of my competitive nature and my love for problem solving.
                                I am hoping to use some of those traits to become a good developer. Game developers will usually work with a creative team on
                                graphic design, theme, characters and level design and layouts. Software developers will then take these ideas and design, develop and test the software
                                making sure it meets the needs of the game's vision. I have an artistic eye so I am hoping that my years of experience in art, and my new training in software development
                                will help reach my goals in becoming a game developer.

                            My recent projects showcase my skills in OOP, React JS, Node, and MongoDB. These include a Clue-style game called "Mastermind of Murder" and the "Can of Books" webpage, which allows users to add, remove, edit, and view lists of books saved on an Atlas database.<br></br>

                            I hold a diploma in Systems Engineering Management from National University and Business Administration Accounting from Argosy University, as well as a Security Plus certification from CompTIA. I am currently enrolled in Full-Stack JavaScript certificate from Code Fellows.<br></br>

                            Currently, I work as a Software Development Analyst for Northrop Grumman Corp, where I support the Enterprise Services Manager by providing data for the Atlassian tool suite and consult on license procurement efforts. I also develop and maintain engineering software lifecycle documents.<br></br>

                            Previously, I worked as a Quality Engineer for Jet Propulsion Laboratory, where I was responsible for assuring design and performance compliance during acquisition of JPL Critical Items. I also ensured the delivery of 10+ flight items for the 2020 Mars Exploration rover.<br></br>

                            I am excited to continue expanding my current skills and abilities and utilize my expertise to deliver high-quality enterprise-wide systems and applications software.<br></br>
